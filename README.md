# Vale-React-Practice

The objective of this project is to create a javascript front-end application that utilises the React framework, using the UIrouter framework to support "Single-Page Application" functionality.

The project will also use the SpringBoot Java-based framework to provide a hosted server for both front-end and back-end operations. Forming the basis for a rudimentary fullstack application.

This project will also incorporate the elements provided in Vale-Javascript-Practice as a foundational state to build from, this will include the adaptation of JS code features such as the console and calculator examples.
